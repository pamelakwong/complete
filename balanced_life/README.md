# Balanced_Life 
Tackle big problems into small problems. 

## Aproach
**Problem:** How to strive forward in a fast paced learning environment?

**Intention:** Just like how weâ€™re learning to program, we must acknowledge our physical, mental, social, emotional states. And then, learn to program healthy habits into our minds.
