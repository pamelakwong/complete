Tackle big problems into small problems. 

## Aproach

## Dedication
In this project, I dedicate it to my Circle TA, Andrew, who helped and believed me along the way even when I did not. I will also dedicate it to those whom I have met and have exuded patience and positivity. Words cannot express how much happiness and new found energy I hold onto now and onwards. Most of all, I dedicate to those friends who continue to work hard at App Academy! (:
